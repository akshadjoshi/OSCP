TYPE OF DNS SERVER (dns server is a kind of database server that resolve queries)
1. authoritative - SEVER that hold records PRIMARY AND SECONDARY dns come under this 
2. non authoritative - don't hold records but they resolve query via help of another server **forwarder** AND **CHACHE ONLY** dns come under this


TYPE OF DNS RECORD

A - ADDRESS MAPPING RECORD (YOU HAVE A DOMAIN NAME AND YOU NEED IPv4 record OF that name this record will give you that) are made on authoritative server under PRIMARY server (we make records here and DNS works on those records)
AAAA - IPv6 record

CNAME - alias name, synonyms or canonical record (www.example.com, example.com, wordpress.example.com, cloudfare) (used this when we use 3rd party vendor so they give there subdomain along with the domain we want)

NS RECORD - the server by which it is resolving or maintaining the paticular domain. The NS record specifies an authoritative name server for the given host. This is that responsible record that points towards the primary and secondary record, basically if you want to know about the name records of a paticular domain and where they are holded


$ nslookup -type=ns <domian name>
SOA - the primary server among all the server avaliable 

$ nslookup -type=soa fackbook.com
OUTPUT
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
fackbook.com
	origin = ns1.bodis.com
	mail addr = dnsadmin.bodis.com
	serial = 2017062202
	refresh = 10800
	retry = 3600
	expire = 1209600
	minimum = 3600
