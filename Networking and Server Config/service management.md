Service maintains our Appication
### Old Methord
<B><sub>service maintained via</sub> **`/etc/init.d/`**
  
```bash 
  ls /etc/init.d/<PRESS TAB TWICE> 
# to see the services maintained/run from this directory  
```
  
```bash
  /etc/init.d/cron status       # will tell you the status of that particular service or appication
  ```
  
  the remaining files go in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`   `` on this location you will get all the service files``
  
```bash
  
 ls /usr/lib/systemd/system
 # to see the service file
  
 Example:-
  
  Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/apache2.service â†’ /lib/systemd/system/apache2.service.
 ```

  you can not directly call a service if it does not have an execution permission
  example:
  
 ls -lha | grep httpd
-rw-r--r--.  1 root root  752 Jan 13  2022 httpd.service
  ```
```bash
  chkconfig --list # run level command
  ```
