TYPE OF DNS SERVER (dns server is a kind of database server that resolve queries)
1. authoritative - SEVER that hold records PRIMARY AND SECONDARY dns come under this 
2. non authoritative - don't hold records but they resolve query via help of another server **forwarder** AND **CHACHE ONLY** dns come under this


TYPE OF DNS RECORD

A - ADDRESS MAPPING RECORD (YOU HAVE A DOMAIN NAME AND YOU NEED IPv4 record OF that name this record will give you that) are made on authoritative server under PRIMARY server (we make records here and DNS works on those records)
AAAA - IPv6 record

CNAME - alias name, synonyms or canonical record (www.example.com, example.com, wordpress.example.com, cloudfare) (used this when we use 3rd party vendor so they give there subdomain along with the domain we want)

NS RECORD - the server by which it is resolving or maintaining the paticular domain. The NS record specifies an authoritative name server for the given host. This is that responsible record that points towards the primary and secondary record, basically if you want to know about the name records of a paticular domain and where they are holded


$ nslookup -type=ns <domian name>
SOA - the primary server among all the server avaliable 

$ nslookup -type=soa fackbook.com
OUTPUT
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
fackbook.com
	origin = ns1.bodis.com
	mail addr = dnsadmin.bodis.com
	serial = 2017062202
	refresh = 10800
	retry = 3600
	expire = 1209600
	minimum = 3600

# working 



DNS, or Domain Name System, is a system that translates domain names (such as www.example.com) into IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.1). It's like a phone book for the internet, mapping website names to their corresponding internet addresses.

Let's say you want to visit the website "www.example.com" in your web browser.

1. First, your computer sends a request to the nearest DNS resolver (ISP) asking for the IP address associated with "www.example.com".

2. The DNS resolver (ISP) will then ask the root name servers (the top level servers which are 13 in no. that knows all the top level domains like .com .in) for the IP address associated with "www.example.com".

3. The root name servers will respond that the address is not known to them, but they will provide the address of the top-level domain server, when the query reaches the TLD name server, the TLD name server answers with the IP of domain name server i.e 8.8.8.8 or your configured dns in centos


6. The DNS resolver will then ask the authoritative name server (that you configure in centos) for the IP address associated with "www.example.com".

like:

dig cipher.local @<yourDNSserverIP>

works only when you have created the records 

7. The authoritative name server will respond with the IP address associated with "www.example.com", which is "192.0.2.1".

The DNS resolver will then provide the IP address "192.0.2.1" to your computer, which will then use it to connect to the website "www.example.com" in your web browser.

That's the process of DNS resolution in a nutshell. The entire process happens in a fraction of a second and is transparent to the user. The DNS resolver will also cache the IP address for a certain period of time, so that it doesn't have to go through the entire proces

# types

types of record :

NS record - toh yeh vo responsible record hota hain jo primary and secondary ko point karta hain. Agar aapko pata karna hain ki koi particular domain hain uske name record kahan hold hue hain means kahan records banae gae hain vi kaun sa server hain for that we will see name server.

it is that responsible server hain jo aap ke sare records ko hold karta hain it has both primary and secondary 

note : jo bhi name resolv ho raha hain primary se ho raha hain  
secondary is used for load balancing

PTR record : pointer record it is opposite to A record logic. You have IP and you need to know the name/domain 

SOA : startup authority record iska kam hota hain master and slave ke beechme coordination bitha na.

HIFO :

MX : mail server ko point/hold karta hain.


PRIMARY NAME SERVER

1 server can have multipal zones

when you have IP you need the name -- reverse zone is used

name ko IP me convert -- forward zone 



ZONE are basically record holding files 


In short, a zone in DNS is a way to organize and manage a specific group of domain names, similar to how books are organized into sections within a library.



<---  zone means

Yes, zones in DNS can be thought of as "record holding files" as they contain the DNS records that map domain names to IP addresses. The zone files contain the information needed for the DNS server to properly resolve domain names to IP addresses for the domain names within its zone of authority.

The zone files hold different types of records like A, MX, CNAME, NS, TXT and more, each one of them serves a different purpose.

For example, an A record maps a domain name to an IP address, an MX record maps a domain name to a mail server, and a CNAME record maps a domain name to another domain name.

It is also important to note that DNS zones can be delegated to other DNS servers, which means that the record holding files can be distributed among different DNS servers.

	DIFF BETWEEN FORWARD AND BACKWORD


In DNS, a forward zone is a zone that maps domain names to IP addresses. This is the primary function of DNS, as it is used to translate domain names (such as www.example.com) into IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.1). This type of zone is called "forward" because it forwards a domain name to an IP address.

On the other hand, a reverse zone, also called a "backward zone" is a zone that maps IP addresses to domain names. This is less common than forward zone, but it can be useful in certain situations. It is called "reverse" because it reverses the process of mapping domain names to IP addresses. Instead of translating a domain name to an IP address, it translates an IP address to a domain name.

The main difference between a forward zone and reverse zone is the way they map the information. A forward zone maps a domain name to an IP address, while a reverse zone maps an IP address to a domain name. Reverse zones are usually used for reverse DNS lookups and help with troubleshooting network issues and also used for anti-spam and anti-fraud mechanisms.








what is a **zone** block in DNS

This block tells the DNS server that the zone "example.com" is a master zone and that its zone file is located at /var/named/example.com.zone

It is important to note that you can have multiple zone blocks in the named.conf, each one of them representing a different zone.


A zone block in DNS is a section of the DNS server's main configuration file (named.conf) that defines and configures a specific zone. The zone block contains information about the zone, such as its name, type, and the location of the zone's file. The zone block is used to define the zone and specify the location of the zone file.

A zone block typically starts with the "zone" keyword, followed by the name of the zone in quotation marks. Inside the curly braces, you can specify various options for the zone. The most common options are the type of the zone, and the location of the zone file. The type of the zone usually is master or slave, and the location of the zone file is a path.
